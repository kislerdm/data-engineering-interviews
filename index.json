This approach is basic and has the time complexity of O(nleft2 + nright2), where nleft = number of \u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo; table\u0026rsquo;s rows, nright = number of the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; table\u0026rsquo;s rows.\nReferences:\n  https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/join/nested-loops-join-n1-problem\n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfuLUE7lccs\n  What is \u0026lsquo;hash join\u0026rsquo;? ⭐️ Hash join is an optimizaton approach database engine may take to speed up a process of tables join. In this case, a in-memory hash table(s) is being generated using the values of the \u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo; table\u0026rsquo;s join key column(s). The hash table values are used afterward to find matching rows of the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; table. The hash join approach is faster compared to the nested loops join, it however has a limitation: whole hash table must fit into memory of the database machine. Another pro of hash join is, one doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to index join key columns. The time complexity of such algorithm is O(nleft + nright), where nleft = number of \u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo; table\u0026rsquo;s rows, nright = number of the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; table\u0026rsquo;s rows.\n!The join method can only be selected by optimizer, if \u0026lsquo;=\u0026rsquo; operator is used as the join condition!\nReferences:\n  https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/join/hash-join-partial-objects\n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlokdBiaMek\n  When hash join may be selected by optimizer? 🚀 TBD\nReferences:\n link1  What\u0026rsquo;s the difference between transactional and analytics databases? 👶 TBD\nReferences:\n link1  What\u0026rsquo;s the difference between star and snowflake schema? 👶 TBD\nReferences:\n link1  Exlapin data normalization process? Why data are being normalized and denormalized in database? What\u0026rsquo;s preferable for analytics db? 👶 TBD\nReferences:\n link1  What is window function? ⭐️ A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. This is comparable to the type of calculation that can be done with an aggregate function. But unlike regular aggregate functions, use of a window function does not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row — the rows retain their separate identities. Behind the scenes, the window function is able to access more than just the current row of the query result.\nReferences:\n https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-window-functions/  How to set dist keys in redshift?

If you see an error, please create a PR with a fix.\nEdit questions     Legend  👶 easy ‍⭐ medium 🚀 expert    What is Apache Hive Metastore? 👶 Metastore is a Hive serivce to store Hive tables and partitions metadata in any JDBC compliant relational database. It provides client access to this information by using metastore service API.\nHive metastore consists of two fundamental units:\n  A service that provides metastore access to other Apache Hive services.\n  Disk storage for the Hive metadata which is separate from HDFS storage.\n  There are three modes for Hive Metastore deployment:\n  Embedded Metastore (default). The metastore service runs in the same JVM as the main HiveServer process and uses embedded Derby database. Such deployment would allow only one Hive session, hense it\u0026rsquo;s not useful for production.\n  Local Metastore. The metastore service runs in the same process as the main HiveServer process, but the metastore database runs in a separate process, and can be on a separate host. The embedded metastore service communicates with the metastore database over JDBC.\n  Remote Metastore. The metastore service runs in its own JVM process. HiveServer and other processes communicate with it using the Thrift network API. The metastore service communicates with the metastore database over JDBC. The database, the HiveServer process, and the metastore service can all be on the same host, but running the HiveServer process on a separate host provides better availability and scalability. The main advantage of Remote mode over Local mode is that Remote mode does not require the administrator to share JDBC login information for the metastore database with each Hive user.\n  References:\n https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/5-8-x/topics/cdh_ig_hive_metastore_configure.html  What is MapReduce, how it works? ⭐ TBD\nReferences:\n  link1\n  link2\n  Assuming that your have developed a pyspark program to process a data batch, how spark executes it? 🚀 TBD\nReferences:\n  link1\n  link2\n  "

If you see an error, please create a PR with a fix.\nEdit questions     Legend  👶 easy ‍⭐ medium 🚀 expert    What is Quality of Service? 👶 The Quality of Service (QoS) level is a sender-receiver agreement to define the guarantee of a message delivery.\nThe following three level of QoS are usually being defined:\n At most once, QoS0 At least once, QoS1 Exactly once, QoS2  QoS0 At most once, or \u0026lsquo;fire and forget\u0026rsquo; level guarantees a best-effort delivery and provides the same level of guarantee as the underlying transmission protocol (e.g. TCP). A client won\u0026rsquo;t receive any confirmation from the broker upon receipt. Likewise a message delivered to a client from the broker is not required to be acknowledged. This is the fastest way to publish and receive messages, but also the one where message loss is most likely to happen.\nWhen to use   When the network connection between sender and receiver is stable\n  Occasional loss of few messages is acceptable when the data is not important or when data is sent at short intervals\n  No message queuing required\n  QoS1 A client will receive a confirmation message from the broker upon receipt. If the expected confirmation is not received within a certain time frame, the client has to retry the message. A message received by a client must be acknowledged on time as well, otherwise the broker will re-deliver the message.\nWhen to use   No message loss is acceptable and duplicates can be handled\n  The overhead of QoS2 is unbearable. QoS1 delivers messages much faster than QoS2.\n  QoS2 This level guarantees that each message is received only once by the intended recipients. It is the safest and slowest quality of service level. The guarantee is provided by at least two request/response flows (a four-part handshake) between the sender and the receiver.\nWhen to use  It is critical to your application to receive all messages exactly once, e.g. when handling purchase transactions  References:\n  https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-6-mqtt-quality-of-service-levels/\n  https://vernemq.com/intro/mqtt-primer/quality_of_service.html\n  Explain how kafka works? ‍⭐ TBD\nReferences:\n  link1\n  link2\n  "
