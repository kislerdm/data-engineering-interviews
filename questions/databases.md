### Name types of join methods RDBMS (e.g. postres) supports? ‍⭐️

As of today, postgres supports three join methods:

- nested loops
- hash join
- merge join

TBD

### What is 'nested loops join'? 👶

It's a basic approach databse engine takes to join two tables: for every value (external loop) of the "left" table's join key column, the engine loops (inner loop) over the values of the "right" table's join key column and selects the matching rows. This approach is basic and has the time complexity of O(n<sub>left</sub><sup>2</sup> + n<sub>right</sub><sup>2</sup>), where n<sub>left</sub> = number of "left" table's rows, n<sub>right</sub> = number of the "right" table's rows.

### What is 'hash join'? ⭐️

Hash join is an optimizaton approach database engine may take to speed up a process of tables join. In this case, a in-memory hash table(s) is being generated using the values of the "left" table's join key column(s). The hash table values are used afterward to find matching rows of the "right" table. The hash join approach is faster compared to the nested loops join, it however has a limitation: whole hash table must fit into memory of the database machine. Another pro of hash join is, one doesn't need to index join key columns. The time complexity of such algorithm is O(n<sub>left</sub> + n<sub>right</sub>), where n<sub>left</sub> = number of "left" table's rows, n<sub>right</sub> = number of the "right" table's rows.

**!The join method can only be selected by optimizer, if '=' operator is used as the join condition!**
